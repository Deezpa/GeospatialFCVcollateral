GeospatialFCVcollateral â€“ Fork by Deepa Shukla
This repository is my fork of the World Bankâ€™s GeospatialFCVcollateral project. The original project curates geospatial and ICT resources to support Fragility, Conflict, and Violence (FCV) operations.
ðŸ”Ž Purpose of this Fork
To explore applications of AI/ML with geospatial datasets in FCV contexts.
To contribute new documentation, use cases, and tutorials for practitioners.
To experiment with integrating carbon MRV data, rural credit scoring insights, and climate-smart finance models into geospatial workflows.
ðŸ“‚ Current Focus Areas
Case Studies: Examples of how AI/ML models can use geospatial data to support FCV operations.
Data Integration: Linking agricultural carbon and soil health indicators with socio-economic vulnerability mapping.
Tutorials: Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks on geospatial analytics for development projects.
Documentation Improvements: Metadata standards, workflows, and explanatory guides for new contributors.
