# Welcome to the Geospatial and ICT Resources Page

On this site you can find supplementary resources for the World Bank training modules related to the intergration of modern data collection processes into global development projects using [Satellite Imagery](#remotesensing), [Drone Imagery](#drones), and [Mobile Phone data](#mobile). Below you can find links to each of these modules, along with additional learning material and other relevant resources.

These training materials were developed by the World Bank in partnership with XXXX and YYYY in 2021. Please feel free to reach out to the World Bank's [Geospatial Operational Support Team (GOST)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/brief/geospatial-operations-support-team-at-the-world-bank) for questions following the completion of the training modules below. 


## Remote Sensing Imagery  <a name="remotesensing"></a>

<img src="imgs/satellite.jpg" alt="Drone" style= "width:100%; height:200px; object-fit:cover;">

In this module, we learned about the basics of satellite imagery and remote sensing, and how such data can be applied to development projects. We learned about the key terms related to remote sensing, and examined how to acquire the right images by learning how to properly define key objectives. We also explored when remote sensing may not be the right data for your project needs, and, finally, we explored various case studies to illustrate how projects have utilized this data in different ways.

## Drone Imagery <a name="drones"></a>

<img src="imgs/drone2.jpg" alt="Drone" style= "width:100%; height:200px; object-fit:cover;">

In this module, you learned some basic information related to drones, as well as how to decide if drone imagery is the appropriate solution for your project, and if so, how to acquire the necessary images. Finally, you examineed the risks associated with using drones in a project for image collection and the safety measures that should be taken to ensure drones are used responsibly.  

Drone imagery also offers the exciting possibility of creating high resolution 3D models of your Area of Interest (AOI). This can be useful for conducting analysis related to volume measurements, line of sight measurements, or simply visualizing your AOI in more detail. With modern software packages, creating 3D models can be automated from your imagery dataset. Look at the links under "Links to Popular Data Processing Software" to find some common software tools used in the industry.

## Mobile Phone Data <a name="mobile"></a>

<img src="imgs/mobilephones.png" alt="Drone" style= "width:100%; height:200px; object-fit:cover;">

In this module, you learned how mobile phone technologies are creating new opportunities to generate, collect, and use data for development insights in fragile settings. You learned how big mobile data that is passively generated from the use of basic mobile phones and location enabled smartphone applications can be repurposed for development insights. You also learned how mobile technologies are being used to improve active data collection in the field and remotely. For example, how enumerators use tablets and smartphones to enhance household surveys conducted in the field, or how the rise in global cell phone usage is making it easier to collect survey data remotely. You explored case studies to understand how develpment data products based on mobile location data can deliver higher resolution insights in areas like human desplacement, poverty measurements and service delivery. Finally, you learned the principles and practices for responsibly using modile data in development work.
